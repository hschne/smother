\_\* improved coverage may or may not vary with your code base and dramatically improved coverage

## Usage

Install Smother and add a _single_ new test calling it.

  Smother.my_code
end
```

Now simply run your tests and enjoy your improved coverage! ü§©

## How It Works

It's really simple.

## FAQ

### Wait, so this doesn't actually _test_ anything?!

Smother improves your test coverage. Your boss won't care how, why do you? _Brrr_, Number go up! üìà

### Why not fake the coverage results altogether?

That would be cheating.

### Is this a joke?

Improving your test coverage is no joke!

### No, really.

Okay. I thought this would be a fun way to play around with introspection and dynamic programming in Ruby. So yes, kind of a joke. Don't use this in production.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that
