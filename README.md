Smother is a _revolutionary_ tool to ‚ú® _magically_ ‚ú® increase your test coverage! Don't just cover your code - smother it! ‚òÅÔ∏è

</div>

## Why Smother?

So you want to improve your test coverage.

Great Idea. But who has time time write more tests? You certainly don't.

Enter **Smother**.

Smother ‚ú® _magically_ ‚ú® improves your test coverage within seconds!

| Without Smother üëé | With Smother ü§© |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| 0%                 | 90%             |

\* _you may experience vastly different results_

## Usage

Install Smother and add a _single_ new test calling it.

```bash
bundle add smother
```

```ruby
test 'smother everything' do
  Smother.my_code
end
```

That's it. Now simply run your tests and enjoy your improved coverage! ü§©

## How It Works

It's really simple.

Smother identifies all public methods in your code base and calls then with appropriate arguments. Any errors will be ignored so your code can continue execution.

This dramatically increases code coverage.

## FAQ

### Wait, so this doesn't actually _test_ anything?!

Smother improves your code coverage. Your boss won't care how, why do you? _Brrr_, Number go up! üìà

### Why not fake the coverage results altogether?

That would be cheating.

### Smothering my code feels... violent?

Smother is efficient, but efficiency comes at a price.

### Is this a joke?

Improving code coverage is not a joke.

### No, really.

I thought this would be a fun way to play around with introspection and dynamic programming in Ruby. I don't actually recommend anyone actually use this.
