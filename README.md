## Why Smother?

So you have some Ruby üíé code and want to improve your test coverage.

Great Idea. But who has time time write more tests? You certainly don't.

Enter **Smother**.

Smother ‚ú® _magically_ ‚ú® improves your test coverage within seconds!


## Usage

Install Smother and call it in your test suite. A single test will do.

```bash
bundle add smother
```

```ruby
test 'smother everything' do
  Smother.my_code
end
```

That's it. Now run your tests and enjoy your improved coverage! ü§©

## How It Works

It's really simple.

Smother identifies and calls all public methods in your code base with appropriate arguments. Any errors are ignored, so your code can continue execution.

This dramatically increases code coverage.

## FAQ

#### Wait, where are the assertions? This doesn't actually _test_ anything?!

Who cares? Smother improves your code coverage. _Brrr_, Number go up! üìà

#### Why not use AI to generate tests?

Why waste your precious credits if Smother can magically improve your code coverage in seconds?

#### Why not fake the coverage results altogether?

That would be cheating.

#### Smothering my code feels... violent?

Smother is efficient, but efficiency comes at a price.

#### Is this a joke?

Improving code coverage is no a joke.

#### No, really.

Okay, I thought this would be a fun way to play around with introspection and dynamic programming in Ruby. 

I don't actually recommend anyone actually use this in any setting anywhere.
